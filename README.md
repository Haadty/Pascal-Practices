# Practices in Pascal

==========================================================================

Some practices in the Pascal language that I'm doing for college are very simple questions with nothing complex, just for basic learning in Pascal.

It's only in Brazilian Portuguese because it's for college

For those who want to know, it all starts on Main.pas, the other files in the src are each question resolved for my work
